Description: This package demonstrates how to utilizing the JAR files from the commonsMath package in a package based on rJava.  Whereas R packages wrapping JAR files typically depend explicitly on rJava, commonsMath only suggests rJava making it also useful for packages based on rscala instead of rJava.  Yet, the way a package based on rJava uses commonsMath is unaffected.  Other developers of R packages wrapping JAR files can follow the lead of commonsMath by slightly modifying their .onLoad function.
