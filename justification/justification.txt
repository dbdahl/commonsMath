This package delivers the JAR file of the Apache Commons Math Library for use by other packages.  Versions of this JAR file are found in several packages on CRAN, including: bartMachineJARs, subspace, ChoR, expands, and my own shallot package.  Once this package is accepted, I will release an update to my shallot package that removes its own copy of this JAR file and adds a dependency on this package.  Perhaps others will find it useful for their packages as well.  I expect this package will rarely need to be updated.  Thanks.
